      # Rin Ragudo


      Graphic, UX, & Web Designer


      ![](/images/lillian.jpg)


      Looking for Lillian Rose Design? The last year or two I have been able to
      understand myself a lot better and have realized that I am gender-fluid.
      Lillian just doesn't feel fit me as a person anymore, so I have changed my
      name to Rin and use they/them pronouns. So please excuse the transition,
      changing your name can be a difficult process .
