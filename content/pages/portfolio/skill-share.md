      Design guidelines for the new timebank for the Airway Heights community.
      Timebanking is a time-based currency. Give one hour of service and receive
      one time credit. You can also use your credits to receive services. The
      community needed a logo and design guidelines to apply to posters, 

      handouts, and their timebanking app. A community leader came to my design
      class and shared about their needs and what the time banking was all
      about. Each student worked individually and presented mockups and printed
      materials at the end of the quarter to some community leaders. At the
      time, they didn't have a name for their time bank, so I came up with Skill
      Reservior hinting at the vast amount of diversity in skills and abilities
      available. This concept became the foundation to the rest of the branding
      guides.
