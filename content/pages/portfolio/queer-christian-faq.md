  - content: "​​Coming out when you spent your childhood going to an evangelical church and a private christian school can be really difficult. I was surprised by all of the accepting people in my life, but there were still a lot of people with questions for me. Questions about what it means to be LGBTQ+ and also how could I be a christian and be pansexual? I don't think these two things are opposites, but certainly most of the world does. Thankfully, my best friend also came out around the same time and we talked about the conversations we were having with people. Those conversations and messages can be exhausting and we thought, \"Wouldn't it be nice to just have a FAQ website to send everyone to?\" It would certainly be a great baseline for a lot of queer and christian conversations. We are both designers, so that’s exactly what we set out to do.\_\n\nNeither of us were prepared for the amount of research that needed to go into the site. It’s not quite finished and there are a few questions that still need answers. We are planning to officially publish the site by the end of October and to continue to add answers and references as we go. It’s a special project to both me and my friend, so I hope that at least a few people find the site helpful.\n\nWebsite preview: https://queer-christian-64ba3.netlify.app/\n"
