      I created this coloring book for myself, my friends, and Instagram
      followers. A common problem that myself and my friends usually had with
      coloring books for adults was that they can be so intricate and detailed
      that you don't even want to start or finish them. In the end many are the
      opposite of relaxing. So I purposely made the pages simple enough to not
      be overwhelmed, but complicated enough so that it did not feel like a
      children's coloring book.
