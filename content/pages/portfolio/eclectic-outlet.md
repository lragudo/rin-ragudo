      I love playing tabletop games with friends and family. Itâ€™s an easy way
      for me to connect with others. However, your first time playing a new game
      can be difficult and the instructions are often long and complicated. I
      was inspired by the creators of Exploding Kittens and their animated
      instructions for all of their games.


      Eclectic Outlet is a card game that is fun and quick for teenagers and
      young adults. This game is also intended to be accessible to anyone as the
      cards are downloadable to print and the instructions are online. I went
      through three card deck prototypes and several rounds of play testing with
      different rules.
