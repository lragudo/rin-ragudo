      The CoLab is a space for Eastern Washington University's Design department
      to hold workshops, student events, and community events. When not in use
      for the event students can meet and work on project or just hang out. The
      space is now called the Innovation Hub. For my senior capstone project I
      led a small team of three designers to create a website for this space.
      Our goal was to create a visual identity and website for the CoLab that
      could go along with other promotional materials other teams were
      designing. The website provides a place for informational and promotional
      material about the space.
