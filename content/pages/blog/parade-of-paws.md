These material were creates during the American Advertising Federation's 24hr Create event. I led a team of four people to design collateral for the Spokane Humane Society's event, Parade of Paws. Although my team's design was not chosen as the winner, I decided the day after the event to redesigned some of the collateral after receiving feedback from local design professionals at the event.
