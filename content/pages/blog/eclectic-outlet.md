I love playing tabletop games with friends and family. Itâ€™s an easy way for me to connect with others. However, your first time playing a new game can be difficult and the instructions are often long and complicated. I was inspired by the creators of Exploding Kittens and their animated instructions for all of their games.

Eclectic Outlet is a card game that is fun and quick for teenagers and young adults. This game is also intended to be accessible to anyone as the 
cards are downloadable to print and the instructions are online. I went through three card deck prototypes and several rounds of play testing with different rules.
