I created this coloring book for myself, my friends, and Instagram followers. A common problem that myself and my friends usually had with coloring books for adults was that they can be so intricate and detailed that you don't even want to start or finish them. In the end many are the opposite of relaxing. So I purposely made the pages simple enough to not be overwhelmed, but complicated enough so that it did not feel like a children's coloring book.
